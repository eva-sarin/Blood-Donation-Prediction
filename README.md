# Blood-Donation-Prediction
Problem
Predicting if a Blood Donor will donate within a given time window?

Application
By solving this problem the blood donation camps can get 40% more blood donors.

Sourcerer


Code Requirements
The example code is in Python (version 3.6.6 or higher will work).

Dependencies
import pandas
import numpy
import seaborn
import matplotlib
import Counter
import sklearn
Description
Use Python to explore data related to blood donors and we want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time when the blood donation will be organised.

This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
The code should run w/o errors.
Appropriate use of
data structures/types
loops/conditional statements
Packages
functions
coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability)
Analysis
Pose questions about the data
Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
Clean the data
Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
Visualize the data (using plt and seaborn)
Perform additional exploratory analysis
Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields.
Feature Engineering
Using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work.
Machine Learning
Use of Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, SVC classifiers.
File Descriptions
./data/ contains the various datasets.
./Blood Donation Prediction.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the work I have done.
